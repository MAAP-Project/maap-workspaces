Since it is difficult to pin the version for R packages because once the current package we have pinned goes
into the archives because a new package was released, the link like https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/codetools_0.2-20.tar.gz
will break because archive needs to be added to the url for that version 
To avoid constantly having to update these links, I propose we just record the package versions for our R packages
in this text file in case we need to reference them later 
The R script called print_package_versions.R will generate a list of all R package versions for the R packages we are installing in install_cran_packages_r.sh
